Repository for 10 Days of ML, a [TFUG Mumbai](https://www.meetup.com/tfugmumbai/) initiative. All the code would be pushed to the repo everyday at around 7 PM IST. The btter part would be all the codes would have explanations, which means if you are stuck on any part I do not advise you to copy/ paste but to understand the conncepts properly.

## Pre-requisite

* You shoud have an urge to learn
* It is ok to fail in some part, but try experimenting with the notebook and the hyper parameters

My blog about this also got featured in official
