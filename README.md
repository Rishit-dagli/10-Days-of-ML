# 10-Days-of-ML
Repository for 10 Days of ML, a TFUG Mumbai initiative. All the code would be pushed to the repo everyday at around 7 PM IST. The btter part would be all the codes would have explanations, which means if you are stuck on any part I do not expect you to copy/ paste but to understand the conncepts properly.

## Pre-requisite

* You shoud have an urge to learn
* It is ok to fail in some part, but try experimenting with the notebook and the hyper parameters

## Making this better

If you have any suggestions or efficient ways of solving the problems please submit a PR after reading the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/10-Days-of-ML/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
